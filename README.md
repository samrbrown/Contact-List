# Contact-List

This is just a simple contact list tasked to my by the masterminds at Net Natives.

I decided to challenge myself and throw myself into the Vue.JS framework, I really enjoyed learning some of the basics this framework for this task. Saying this, I am fully aware I have just about scratched the surface of the possibilities that Vue gives.

Although I did say I tried to throw myself into Vue, I was a little cautious and didnt want to go too far and get lost, so I decided to use a direct `<script>` include rather than npm or the CLI. These are something I will be looking at in my free time and to try and get to grasps with.
