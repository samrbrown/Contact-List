# Contact List

This is just a simple contact list tasked to me by the masterminds at Net Natives.

I decided to challenge myself and throw myself into the Vue.JS framework, I really enjoyed learning some of the basics this framework for this task. Saying this, I am fully aware I have just about scratched the surface of the possibilities that Vue gives.

Although I did say I tried to throw myself into Vue, I was a little cautious and didnt want to go too far and get lost, so I decided to use a direct `<script>` include rather than npm or the CLI. These are something I will be looking at in my free time to try and get to grasps with.

## My thoughts about the task

As I have said already, I have enjoyed this task, but it has made me realise parts of my skills I need to work:

- I need a deeper understanding of VS Code and the integration with GitHub, as although I am able to use it, I do feel I am using it a bit clunkily (if thats a word). I can see myself working this out in a very short time though as I think it's just because I haven't been using it on a day to day basis.

- I need to upskill myself in regards to mixins and variables when using .scss. This will not only make my work better, but also make my life easier.

* I found a little trouble getting the input values when for updating contacts and I think there must be an easier and more succinct way of doing so.

* I think my commenting and naming conventions could use a little work to make them easier to understand. Similar to using Github, I think day-to-day use will improve this quickly.

## Future updates

- Better form validation - currently a very basic one in place, but something more advanced and secure as well as better looking.

- Form placement - I think this could use a little work to make it a better user experience.

- Profile pictures - The ability to add profile pictures as well as setting default ones for those that aren't set.

- Switch to a NPM or CLI build.

- Scrollbar added to contact list.

## Setup

All that is needed is to either clone this repository or download it locally and it should be ready to go.
